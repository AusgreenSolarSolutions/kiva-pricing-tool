**React Router**
* What is React Router
    * Different parts that make up react router that we will probably be using: 
        * Route: IMPORTANT! renders a specific UI when a location matches the routeâ€™s path.
        * Link: helps us navigate within our application
        * Router: The common low-level interface for all router components
            * Types of Routers
                * Browser Router
                * Hash Router 
                * Memory Router
                * Native Router
                * Static Router
        * Redirect: used to navigate to new location

**Implementing Visualizations into React**
* What is d3.js?
    * d3 stands for data driven documents and it is a JavaScript Library that enables us to create interactive visualizations by manipulating data-driven documents.

**Making AJAX requests and using Axios**
* What is an AJAX request?
    * AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML and it enables us to send and get information to the server asynchronously.
* What is axios?
    * Axios is a Javascript library used to make http requests from node.js/XMLHttpRequests from the browser and it supports the Promise API.
* What are promises?
    * Promise are software abstraction used to overcome issues with multiple callbacks and provide better way to manage success and error conditions.
        * This means that there are no more nested callback 
    * The point of promises is to give us back functional composition and error bubbling in the async world
    * Promises have three states:
        * pending: means the async operation is going on.
        * resolved: async operation is completed successfully.
        * rejected: async operation is completed with error.

**SQL Alchemy**
* What is SQL Alchemy?
    * SQL Alchemy is an Object Relational Mapper that allows you to access and manipulate the database with python.

**Jsonify** 
* Jsonify returns a flask response object that already has the appropriate content-type header 'application/json' for use with json responses

**JSON to SQL**

**Converting Info from Server to JSON**
* What is Serialization?
    * Serialization is the process of converting the state information of an object instance into a binary or textual form to persist into storage medium or transported over a network.
* Converting time into JSON
```python
    def datetime_to_string(value):
       if value is None:
           return None
       return [value.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"), value.strftime("%H:%M:%S")]
```
* Serializing for JSON
```python
    def serialize(self):
       return {
           'id': self.id,
           'modified_at': dump_datetime(self.modified_at),
           'objects'  : self.serialize_objects #when u have many-to-many relations
       }

    def serialize_objects(self):
       return [ item.serialize for item in self.objects]
       
    return jsonify(json_list=[i.serialize for i in qryresult.all()])
```

**How to Download CSV from Database**
```python
    import csv

    outfile = open('mydump.csv', 'wb')
    outcsv = csv.writer(outfile)
    records = session.query(MyModel).all()
    [outcsv.writerow([getattr(curr, column.name) for column in MyTable.__mapper__.columns]) for curr in records]
    # or maybe use outcsv.writerows(records)
    outfile.close()
```
